# Population dynamics of toxin-producing bacteria 

 * Authors: Marijn Meerveld and Joshua van Waardenberg

## Introduction

At the NLSEB conference we saw Hilje Doekes' presentation about toxin production in bacteria. 
In this presentation Hilje Doekes talked about toxic, immune and sensitive bacteria living together.
It is suprising that these bacteria can coexist because the number of food resources equals the number of species that can live together. 
Therefore one would expect that only one of the three sorts of bacteria survives.
But we know that these bacteria can live together [1].
We thought that this is a interesting topic so we wanted to replicate Hilje Doekes' setup.

## Hypothesis

we think that those tree bacteria can live together, because the bacteria create a rock-paper-scissors relationship,
where each bacteria can displace another bacteria in a circular order: 
toxic displaces sensitive, sensitive displaces immune, immune displaces toxic [1].

## Material and Methods

For this research we will use a computer moddel [1].

### Simulation

 * A bacterium can yes/no produce toxins
 * A bacterium can yes/no be immune to toxins
 * A bacterium that is not immune to toxins dies from toxins
 * Producing toxins is costly
 * Being immune to toxins is costly
 * Bacteria are in a 100x100 grid, each cell has either one bacterium, or is empty

## Results

## Conclusion

## Discussion

To keep things simple we didn't implement everything like Hilje Doekes did.
