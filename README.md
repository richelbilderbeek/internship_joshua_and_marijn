## Questions for supervisors

### Who is Marijn?

Marijn is a 16 year old scholar,
that followed Richel's Arduino course and worked
on building a 3D printer.

### What should I do during my slot

You can fill the time in any way you like.

Consider:

 * telling/showing your work
 * teaching some basic biology, to prepare him for NLSEB and the TRES meeting
 * show the lab/campus/etc
 * taking a walk

### A slot of 90 minutes is too long for one person

Slots can also be filled with more than one person :wink:

### Aaah! I cannot be there! What should I do?

It's fine. Just let Richel or Marijn or any colleague know. 
We'll find a solution :+1:

### What is the goal of the internship?

To learn how working at a university is like.

### What will the intern deliver?

At April 18th 16:00, he'll hand in a report to answer the question:

> How do biologists investigate nature?
