# Population dynamics of toxin-producing bacteria 

 * Authors: Marijn Meerveld and Joshua van Waardenberg

## Introduction

## Material and Methods

### Simulation

 * A bacterium can yes/no produce toxins
 * A bacterium can yes/no be immune to toxins
 * A bacterium that is not immune to toxins dies from toxins
 * Producing toxins is costly
 * Being immune to toxins is costly
 * Bacteria are in a 100x100 grid, each cell has either one bacterium, or is empty
