# Population dynamics of toxin-producing bacteria 

 * Authors: Marijn Meerveld and Joshua van Waardenberg

## Introduction

At the NLSEB conference we saw Hilje Doekes' presentation about toxin production in bacteria. 
In this presentation Hilje Doekes talked about toxic, immune and sensitive bacteria living together.
It is suprising that these bacteria can coexist because one would expect the bacteria sensitive to the toxins to die.
But we know that these bacteria can live together [1].
We thought that this is a interesting topic so we wanted to replicate Hilje Doekes' setup about how this works.

## Hypothesis

we think that those tree bacteria can live together, because the bacteria create a sort of rock-paper-scissors relationship, where each bacteria can displace an other bacteria[1].

## Material and Methods

For this research we will use a computer moddel [1].

### Simulation

 * A bacterium can yes/no produce toxins
 * A bacterium can yes/no be immune to toxins
 * A bacterium that is not immune to toxins dies from toxins
 * Producing toxins is costly
 * Being immune to toxins is costly
 * Bacteria are in a 100x100 grid, each cell has either one bacterium, or is empty

## Results
