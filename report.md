# Population dynamics of toxin-producing bacteria 

 * Authors: Marijn Meerveld and Joshua van Waardenberg

## Introduction

At the NLSEB conference we saw Hilje Doekes' presentation about toxin production in bacteria. 
In this presentation Hilje Doekes talked about toxic, immune and sensitive bacteria living together.
[RB: why is it unexpected that multiple bacteria can coexist on one food source?] 
Hilje Doekes also recommended a article called "Local Dispersal promotes biodiversity in a real game of rock-paper-scissors" for more information about this. 
[RB: Use a form like: 'We know ... [1]', where [1] is a reference (see below), use Google Scholar to find a nice format]
We thought that this is a interesting topic and 
we wanted to do a little research on whether these three bacteria can live together.
[RB: I think first we'll replicate her setup :-)]

## Hypothesis

we think that those tree bacteria can live together.
[RB: Why?]

## Material and Methods

For this research we will use a computer moddel.
[RB: From which paper?]

### Simulation

 * A bacterium can yes/no produce toxins
 * A bacterium can yes/no be immune to toxins
 * A bacterium that is not immune to toxins dies from toxins
 * Producing toxins is costly
 * Being immune to toxins is costly
 * Bacteria are in a 100x100 grid, each cell has either one bacterium, or is empty

## Results

## Conclusion

## Discussion

[RB: Write the simplifications you did here]
