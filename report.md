# Population dynamics of toxin-producing bacteria 

 * Authors: Marijn Meerveld and Joshua van Waardenberg

## Introduction

At the NLSEB conference we saw Hilje Doekes' presentation about toxin production in bacteria. In this presentation Hilje Doekes talked about toxic, immune and sensitive bacteria living together. Hilje Doekes also recommended a article called "Local Dispersal promotes biodiversity in a real game of rock-paper-scissors" for more information about this. We thought that this is a interesting topic and we wanted to do a little research on whether these three bacteria can live together.

## Hypothesis

we think that those tree bacteria can live together.

## Material and Methods

For this research we will use a computer moddel.

### Simulation

 * A bacterium can yes/no produce toxins
 * A bacterium can yes/no be immune to toxins
 * A bacterium that is not immune to toxins dies from toxins
 * Producing toxins is costly
 * Being immune to toxins is costly
 * Bacteria are in a 100x100 grid, each cell has either one bacterium, or is empty
